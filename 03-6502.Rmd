# The 6502 

sixty-five-oh-two

## System Organisation

A microcomputer (cause they were a lot smaller than other computers in the 70s..) looks like:

It consists of:

* The _microprocessor_ (MPU), ie, the 6502. This has 3 buses:
    * The _data-bus_
    * The _address-bus_
    * The _control-bus_

The MPU requires precision timing, supplied by a dope crystal. It supples the features of a _central processing unit_ (CPU). This includes:
* The _arithmetic-logical-unit_ (ALU)
* The _control-unit_ (CU)

Other parts of the machine are: 

* _Read Only Memory_ (ROM)
* _Random Access Memory_ (RAM)
* The Programmable I/O (PIO)

## Internal Organisation

* The ALU. This has 2 inputs, accumulates them
* The pin diagram

## Instruction Cycle

It has to send/ recieve signals. Coolio.

## The Stack (but not the heap)
