# Data Representation {#bin}

We need to look at the computer's internal and external representation of data - this is binary and ASCII. Its external representation (what we have as input or output) is decimal or hexadecimal.

## Internal Representations 

* A bit is a binary digit - a 0 or a 1

* 4 bits is a nibble, 8 is a byte

Microprocessors, like the 6502, store data internally as bytes. This data will need to be the program instructions and the data itself. The data will either be numeric or alphanumeric.

### Program Instructions

A program is essentially a list of instructions. These are stored as single or multiple bytes. The 6502 fetches bytes from memory. Therefore, a single byte instruction is faster than a multiple byte instruction. This is an important consideration when programming the 6502. The instructions the 6502 has will be discussed later.

### Numeric Data

#### Signed Binary {-}

The left most bit is used for the sign. 

1 is: ```0000 0001``` while -1 is: ```1000 0001```

Some problems:

* The maximum magnitude is now 127 - we can maybe live with that
* Addition doesn't work

#### One and Two's Complement {-}

One's Complement:

1 is ```0000 0001``` while -1 is: ```1111 1110```

Addition still does not work

Two's Complement:

You do One's Complement, then, for the negative number, add 1

3 is: ```0000 0011``` while -3 is ```1111 1101```

Everything Works! This is the representation of binary that will be used from now on. 

#### The Carry and the Overflow {-}

While adding/ subtracting numbers there are things to look for.

* If you add 128 (```1000 0000```) and 129 (```1000 0001```) is 257. The binary addition will result in ```(1) 0000 0001```. This extra, ninth bit, is the **Carry** bit. This needs to be recognised and handled inside the processor. 

* Adding 64 (```0100 0000```) and 65 (```0100 0001```) results in ```1000 0001```, which is -127, and wrong. This is because of an internal carry from bit 6 to bit 7. When this bit change, that results in a sign change, occurs, this is what is called the **Overflow** bit.

### Alphanumeric Data

Its ASCII, you get it.

## External Representations

Its hexadecimal, you get it.

Sometimes just like decimals as well, you also get it.

fuck BCD and octadecimal.
