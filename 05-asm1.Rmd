# Intro to the 6502 Assembly

This is the point of this notes, yeah!

## What is Assembly?

Very low level language, really as low as you can go.

How does 6502 asm differ from x86, and why?

## Introducing Instructions
### Addition (CLC, CLD, LDA, ADC, STA)

```
    CLC             ; clear carry bit    
    CLD             ; clear decimal bit

    LDA     ADR1    ; load op1 into accumulator
    ADC     ADR2    ; add op2 to accumulator
    STA     ADR3    ; save result to adr3
```

### Subtraction (SEC, SBC)

```
    CLD             ; clear decimal bit
    SEC             ; set carry to 1

    LDA     ADR1    ; load op1 into accumulator
    SBC     ADR2    ; op1 - op2
    STA     ADR3    ; save result to adr3
```

### Multiplication (LDX, LSR, BCC, ASL, ROL, DEX, BNE)

```
        LDA     #0       ; zero accumulator
        STA     TMP      ; clear adress
        STA     RESAD    ; clear
        STA     RESAD+1  ; clear
        LDX     #8       ; x is a counter
MULT    LSR     MPRAD    ; shift mpr right
        BCC     NOADD    ; test carry bit
        LDA     RESAD    ; load a with low res
        CLC 
        ADC     MPDAD    ; add mpd to res
        STA     RESAD    ; save result
        LDA     RESAD+1  ; add rest off shifted mpd
        ADC     TMP      
        STA     RESAD+1
NOADD   ASL     MPDAD    ; shift mpd left
        ROL     TMP      ; save bit from mpd
        DEX              ; decrement counter
        BNE     MULT     ; go again if counter 0
```

### Division
### Some Logic (CMP, BEQ, AND, ORA, EOR)

## Subroutines

## Compiling and running code with Merlin

* the addition and multiplication examples
* using merlin
* commands
* compiling and running code
* checking the answer
